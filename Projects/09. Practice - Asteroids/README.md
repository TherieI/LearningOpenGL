# Asteroids



The first game I worked on in OpenGL. This project imitates the retro "80s" game *Asteroids*. All the code within the `BaseProject` subfolder is my own, excepting `glad.c`. Other dependencies are not.

I plan on changing some of the shaders to improve the visuals, but the the core gameplay is done.
