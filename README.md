# OpenGL research

*By Gabriel Rosas*

This repository contains projects that I did to learn OpenGL. In order to learn, I created guides (more for my benefit than anything else), though they might be of use to others beginning the same journey. The guides are in their respective projects. I also recorded some of the problems that I had, along with their respective solutions that I troubleshooted.



## Projects

1. [Creating a Window][1]
2. [Coloring Triangles with Shaders][2]
3. [Creating a Rainbow Shader with EBOs][3]
4. [Textures][4]
5. [Transformations][5]
6. [Coordinates and 3D space][6]
7. [Moving in 3D space with a Camera][7]
8. Practice
   * [Selection Sort Algorithm Visualization][8]
   * [Asteroids][9] (Retro Arcade Game)
   * [Experimenting with Shaders][10]
